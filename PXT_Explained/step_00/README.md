# Some Useful Stuff Based on the C/C++ Preprocessor

This is a series of exercises starting very basic with some
useful stuff (for learning C++) which is based on the C/C++
Preprocessor. Most of the steps following concentrate on
usability, nota on than on making it "nice". Only in the
last steps things will be cleaned up to reduce the use of
the C/C++ preprocessor to the necessary minimum.

## Practical exercises
 
In each of the steps you will find a *TODO*.
* It details the modifications you are meant to make to
  the prepared code.
* Such steps are usually tiny and (hopefully) aren't an
  insurmountable blocking point. But if so and you are
  working in a classic course setting, feel free to request
  help.
* If you work on your own, as **the model solution for each
  step is in the prepared code for the next step**, you can
  lookup the solution there.
* Doing so will prepare you to ask informed questions when
  the solution is discussed later.

There is also a *README* summarizing what has been done to
  come to a solution.
* **Be sure to understand we're now speaking of the
  *README* being part of the NEXT step, AFTER the one
  you work on when following a specific *TODO*.**
* To keep the *README* brief it does not repeat the steps
  detailed in the *TODO* (of the previous step).
* It only summarizes the overall result achieved so far.
* Another purpose of the *README* can be to explain some
  aspects which may not be obvious at first glance.
* Also the *README* may explain alternative approaches,
  so that the pro's and con's can be discussed later.
  * Usually such code variants are either adjacent to each
    other and protected by comments, except for the one
    actually taking effect.
  * Or they enclosed in conditionally compiled code
    sections which can be selectively enabled.

**NOTE for users of the Platform *Coding Rooms*:**
> If you work on yourself in the "Flipped Classroom"
  approach the *README* may be in the initial section
  **Model Solution** of the *Assignment Prompt while the
  *TODO* follows in the section **Practical Exercise**.

> If instead you load the step as "Class Room Exercise"
  in a classical course setting both are actual files,
  called `README.md` and `TODO.md`. To view the content
  you need to open the file in the editor window. As the
  content is written in *Markdown* it is well readable,
  even as pain text. But to avoid line wrapping you should
  make the editor window at least 60 characters wide.
