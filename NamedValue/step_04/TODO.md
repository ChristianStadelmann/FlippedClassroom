Again we are doing "true TDD" here by first implementing the
test before the functionality is completed. Though this time
is at least partially implemented, as

-   we do not get a compile error and
-   no code is commented out.

This is the output when the program is RUN:

```
g++ main.cpp -o main
... Developing `class NamedValue` (Stream Output Test)
::: main[11]    t -->   != height: 12
::: main[15]    t -->   != height: -1
=== main.cpp: 6 tests , 2 FAILED
```

Looking in the main function line 11 and line 15 shows that
now an object of type `NamedValue` is directly handed over
as second argument to `PX_`.

**This means there needs to be an implementation of**
`operator<<` **for** `NamedValue`**s as** `PX` **and** `PX_`
**expect the argument value can be sent to a stream to get a
human readable representation.**

A closer look at into file `NamedValue.h` reveals there
actually is one at the end but it is obviously incomplete as
it does nothing at all (except returning its Â first
argument).

Obviously the task now is to add an implementation to the
skeleton of `operator<<` which

-   writing the name and the value of the NamedValue
    (accessible by argument `rhs`) ...
-   ... separated by a colon and a space ...
-   ... on the output stream (accessible by argument `lhs` )
